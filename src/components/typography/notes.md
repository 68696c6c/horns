> designers think in terms of points and letting

curning: the spacing between letters, always tweaked manually
letting: spacing between lines
spacing: spacing before and after the line, spacing between paragraphs; indenting: the spacing on left or right on a line
em: a unit of space
size: size of font; use points (preferred) or pica
weight: a specific form of the font-face, 'family' includes things like 'font light', 'font bold'
font: name of the family, e.g. Mont, Times New Roman, Arial
typeface: e.g. Arial bold
style: things like underline (referred to as rule or border) that aren't part of the font itself; headers, body, etc, a combination of size, weight, spacing, etc
  - paragraph styles: the default styles for headings and body
    - nested style: things like first character of a paragraph being fancy (called "drop caps"), or a specific word being different (that would be a nested style)
      - Nested Styles are Character Styles + rules of when to apply them
  - character styles: the exceptions to the rules, e.g. things like italic, color, changing a very specific attribute
-> probably want to support a Prominent style

lists: bullets and numbering also need to incorporate typographic concepts
- define list levels, e.g.  1, a, i

hyphenation: when to hyphenate (e.g. don't hyphenate accross columns, lines etc)
justification: measured min and max and desired (ideal) percentages
  - word spacing: justify by spacing the words
  - letter spacing: justify by spacing the letters
  - glyph scaling: less common, scaling the characters themselves

*blocks and paragraphs ???
- block: is a block of text, non-technical term; perhaps small snippets of text that don't require as much thought
- paragraph: large sections of text that require consideration of more concepts like rythym etc.

The Elements of Typographic Style, 4th edition

## Rythym and Proportion
- average character count per line
- vertical motion
harmony and counterpoint: the relationship of sizing

## Choosing and Combining Type
- combining fonts tip: look at the 'o's to see how differnt fonts work together; compatible fonts will often have similar 'o'
