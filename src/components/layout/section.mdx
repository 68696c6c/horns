# Section

A Section is a semantic layout element that confines its contents to the page content area and supports colorways.

<FullscreenDemo variant="dark" of={Section} title="Section">
  <Section>
    <Paragraph>These Sections have had their padding highlighted to illustrate how the padding works.</Paragraph>
  </Section>
  <Section colorway="warning">
    <Paragraph>Sections are semantic content areas that horizontally center their contents on the page.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>Sections also add a bit of vertical padding around their contents.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>Both of these features can be disabled, allowing the Section to be used as a simple themable content area.</Paragraph>
  </Section>
  <Section colorway="danger" fluid>
    <Paragraph>This Section's horizontal centering has been disabled, making it fluid.</Paragraph>
  </Section>
