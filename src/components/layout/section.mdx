# Section

A Section is a semantic layout element that confines its contents to the page content area and supports colorways.

<FullscreenDemo variant="dark" of={Section} title="Section">
  <Section>
    <p style={{ marginTop: 0, color: 'white' }}>These Sections have had their padding highlighted to illustrate how the padding works.</p>
  </Section>
  <Section colorway="warning">
    <p>Sections are semantic content areas that horizontally center their contents on the page.</p>
    <p>Sections also add a bit of vertical padding around their contents.</p>
    <p>Both of these features can be disabled, allowing the Section to be used as a simple themable content area.</p>
  </Section>
  <Section colorway="danger" contained={false}>
    <p>This Section's horizontal centering has been disabled, making it fluid.</p>
  </Section>
  <Section colorway="info" padded={false}>
    <p>This Section's vertical padding has been disabled.</p>
  </Section>
</FullscreenDemo>
